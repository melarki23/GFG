                <h4>What on earth is Warhammer 40k?</h4>
            <p>Warhammer 40k is a table top battle game, consiting of little bitty models known as minitures.  It is more than a game though, because you have to build the models, paint the models and if you're really into it magnetize the models so you can change out the weapons.
                The game itself is pretty complicated as each army has it's own set of rules, and there are several armies(32 of them!). The armies are based on points, with each unit or character being worth a certain number of points.  Games are typically played with 500 point armies or
                2000 point armies. It is a turn based game; each player has a turn that involves several phases.  I've never really gotten into playing warhammer but I do love putting together the models.  My other favorite part of this hobby is the tournaments.  If they are played locally it means I get the weekend to myself
            or I can go watch if I want to but each round usually lasts around 3 hours and there are typically 2-3 rounds each day of a 2 day tournament.  If they are really dedicated to it you get to travel, like we went to Las Vegas last year for a teams tournament.  He plays all day and I get to relax and let loose!</p>
